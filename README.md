## FAQ
  Q: Can I get banned or punished by Discord for using this?  
  A: **No. The RPC was made by Discord themselves and Spoticord has been recommended by Discord staff**

  Q: I don't see the progress bar, where's it gone?  
  A: **Make sure you're using Discord Canary. Even still, Discord might remove this feature from time to time to update it since canary is a development version of Discord.**

  Q: Can I host this on an external server?  
  A: **No, the Discord RPC api runs on your local Discord client, and unless you want to port forward a few things and create necessary firewall rules to do it, it's not worth it. You'd have to repeat that with the Spotify web helper api, too.**

  Q: I'm not experienced with this scope of programming, are there any tutorials?  
  A: **Yes! I found a few on YouTube:**

  Q: I found an obscure error not mentioned in the troubleshooting section, what should I do?  
  A: **First, check the closed (and open) issues on this repo, we might have answered it there already. If not, create a new one with the WHOLE error and when it occurred (during start, runtime, etc). Thank you!**

## Troubleshooting
### It says the song is being updated but it isn't being displayed on my profile?
  - Go to Discord settings
  - Go to "Games"
  - Make sure "Display currently running game as a status message" is ticked

### Invalid token function (or something similar)
  - Make sure your node is updated, you need at LEAST version 8.0.0!

### `stdout maxBuffer exceeded` or some XML/CSV parse error
  - This is due to an outdated library which tries to help with Windows support
  - Go to node_modules, go to wintools, go to lib
  - Open ps.js
  - On line 11, replace the whole line with:
  `exec('wmic process list /format:csv', {maxBuffer: 2000*1024}, function (err, stdout, stderr) {`
